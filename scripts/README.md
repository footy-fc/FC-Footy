# Scripts Directory

This directory previously contained migration and utility scripts for the FC-Footy application. These scripts have been removed as they are no longer needed.

## Migration Status

All team migration scripts have been successfully completed and removed:
- ✅ Team data migration completed
- ✅ League structure migration completed  
- ✅ Logo updates completed
- ✅ Duplicate team cleanup completed

## Current State

The application now uses a Redis-based team management system with:
- Automated team creation and management
- League membership management
- Real-time logo validation and fallbacks
- Admin interface for team operations

No manual migration scripts are required for normal operation.
