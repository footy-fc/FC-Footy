## The Referee's Role

The referee plays a crucial role in ScoreSquare:

- **Trusted Individual**: The referee is a trusted person responsible for entering the correct scores from the actual match.
- **Score Entry**: After the match ends, the referee enters both the halftime and final scores to determine the winning squares.
- **Prize Distribution**: The referee has the authority to distribute the prize pool to the winning square(s).
- **Refund Authority**: The referee can initiate a full refund if fewer than 25 tickets are sold or if the game needs to be cancelled.
- **Fairness**: In cases where the exact score might not be on the grid, the referee can select the closest square(s) as the winner(s).

## Important Note

ScoreSquare is a **money game based on luck**, not skill or prediction accuracy. The outcome depends entirely on which squares you purchase and the actual scores of the match. Like any lottery, there's no guarantee of winning, but the more squares you purchase, the better your chances.
